# Stray Mods
All of the classes for casting that are used in this project are from [here](https://github.com/Stray-Modding/HK_Project).

This repository is my personal UE4 modding project. All mods are included under `Content/Mods`. They are included as submodules, if you have your own project and want to import one of them to check something, please check the organizations README.

The repository is intended to give new modders some examples on how the cast to in game classes works as well as the possibilities modding provides for the game as there is currently not much information on the topic.

STRAY and any other trademarks used throughout this project are the property of their respective owners.

# Installation
Since the mods are implemented as submodules you have two options **OR YOUR FOLDERS WILL BE EMPTY**.
- Use `--recurse-submodules` in your git command: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Bass-StrayMods/UE4-Project.git` or `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Bass-StrayMods/UE4-Project.git`
- After doing a normal clone do: `git submodule init && git submodule update`
